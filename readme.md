# Utah's Custom Learning Plan

## Topics

- positioning content with CSS
- accessibility
- HTML forms
- basic js for DOM interaction and manipulation
- exploring the powers of SASS
- building responsive sites

## Learning Goals & Deliverables

- experience using grid layouts, floating, and flexbox for positioning
- comfort with the principles of accessible web design
- creating a checklist of highest return accessibility features that should be included in work projects, perhaps divided into priority items for future & past projects
- creating & giving a 30-60 minute "lunch and learn" presentation to colleagues on fundamentals of accessible web design and action items/tools that everyone can use to improve (including above checklist)
- experience building HTML forms with Javascript back ends
- experience building Rails HTML forms
- experience building small Javascript programs that interact with the user and manipulate the DOM
- retrofitting existing Rails projects with better styling, using SASS variables, partials, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and math
- reading [Responsive Design: Patterns & Principles](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-design-patterns-principles) with colleagues, ideally leading a book club with discussions
- convert a styled existing Rails project to be responsive
- dissect how Bootstrap's responsive grid works
- convert an existing small Javascript project to be responsive

## Using This Repo
Fork this repository. Complete your work within it. For assignments that require retrofitting an existing project, submit the work by pasting a link to the Pull Request that contains the work in the existing repo to the assignment page.

## Assignments
Assignments can be done in whatever order the student chooses, unless otherwise specified. At least one should be completed per week. Student will submit a pull request for each assignment, and recieve code review there.

### HTML & CSS

- h1: In the included 'positioning-practice' directory, complete the four provided stylesheets. Follow the instructions in each stylesheet on how to make the provided HTML match the mockup. The goal is to practice positioning items, so matching things like padding or positioning of content within elements is not strictly necessary.

### Responsive Design

- r1: In the provided bootstrap_responsiveness_analysis.md file, explain how Boostrap's responsive grid works. Include details about how users trigger it and how it is implemented. This will require a study of the [Bootstrap source code](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). Include code samples and screenshots as necessary. This should be at least 500 words long.
